### 4. APK Signature Verification
```
jar verified.

Warning: 
This jar contains entries whose certificate chain is invalid. Reason: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
This jar contains entries whose signer certificate is self-signed.
This jar contains signatures that do not include a timestamp. Without a timestamp, users may not be able to validate this jar after any of the signer certificates expire (as early as 2053-02-03).
POSIX file permission and/or symlink attributes detected. These attributes are ignored when signing and are not protected by the signature.

The signer certificate will expire on 2053-02-03.

### GO/NO-GO Decision: **GO** ‚úÖ

**Recommendation**: **SEND TO TEST TEAM**

**Reasoning**:
- All build processes completed successfully
- JS bundle properly embedded (1.26MB)
- Complete native library coverage for all architectures
- Proper release configuration (no debug flags)
- APK signed and verified
- Ready for standalone deployment

**Next Steps**:
1. Connect Android device/emulator via ADB
2. Execute installation commands from DEVICE_TEST_COMMANDS.md
3. Validate OCR, NFC, and Liveness detection functionality
4. Confirm standalone operation without development server

**Deliverables**:
- `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-universal-release.apk` (43.7MB)
- `DEVICE_TEST_COMMANDS.md` (testing guide)
- `RELEASE_REPORT.md` (comprehensive documentation)
