- **Package**: com.ocrmobilesdk v1.0.0
- **Compatibility**: Android 7.0+ (API 24+)
- **Architecture**: Universal (supports all devices)
- **Status**: Production-ready, standalone operation

---

### ✅ Pre-Testing Validation Complete

All technical requirements verified:
- ✅ JS Bundle embedded (1.26MB) - no Metro dependency
- ✅ Native libraries included (168 files, all architectures)
- ✅ Release configuration (debuggable=false)
- ✅ APK signed and verified
- ✅ Standalone operation confirmed

---

### 🎯 Testing Priorities

**Phase 1 - Installation & Launch**
```bash
adb devices
adb install -r app-universal-release.apk
adb shell am start -n com.ocrmobilesdk/com.ocrmobilesdk.MainActivity
```

**Phase 2 - Core Feature Validation**
1. **OCR Testing**: Document scanning, text extraction accuracy
2. **NFC Testing**: Card detection and data reading
3. **Liveness Detection**: Face detection and anti-spoofing

**Phase 3 - Log Monitoring**
```bash
adb logcat -v time | grep -E "(OCRMobileSDK|ReactNativeJS|ERROR|FATAL)"
```

---

### 📋 Success Criteria

**Must Pass:**
- App launches without crashes
- All three features accessible and functional
- No Metro server dependencies detected
- Bundle loads from assets successfully
- No critical errors in application logs

**Performance Targets:**
- App startup < 3 seconds
- Smooth camera preview (30fps)
- Memory usage < 200MB
- No ANR events

### 📦 Testing Package Included

**Files Attached:**
1. `app-universal-release.apk` - Production APK
2. `COMPREHENSIVE_DEVICE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Detailed testing procedures
3. `TEST_TEAM_GO_NOGO_REPORT.md` - Technical validation summary
4. `DEVICE_TEST_COMMANDS.md` - Quick reference ADB commands

### 🔧 Quick Start Commands

**Essential Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Install APK
adb install -r app-universal-release.apk

# Launch application
adb shell am start -n com.ocrmobilesdk/com.ocrmobilesdk.MainActivity

# Monitor logs
adb logcat -v time | grep -E "(OCRMobileSDK|ERROR|FATAL)"

# Verify standalone operation
adb logcat -d | grep -E "(localhost:8081|Metro|DevServer)" && echo "⚠️ DEPENDENCY" || echo "✅ STANDALONE"
```

### ⚠️ Known Considerations

- **Self-signed certificate**: Suitable for internal testing, not Play Store distribution
- **Device requirement**: Physical Android device or emulator needed
- **Permissions**: Camera, NFC access required for full feature testing
